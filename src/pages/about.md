Hello there! I'm Ryan Jordan, the brains and brawn behind this blog. My coding adventure started with a small Macbook Air on my couch and has since taken me through the thrilling realms of startups, massive corporations, and even the meticulous world of government projects. Over the last 11 years, I've turned my passion for problem-solving into a full-stack development career, mastering tools like Angular, React, NextJS, Redux, and Docker along the way.

But it's not just about the code. My true calling lies in demystifying the complexities of technology. Here, I share my knowledge, experiences, and the occasional misstep (because we're all human!), aiming to inspire and educate. Whether it's a deep dive into the latest tech or a simple how-to guide, my goal is to make you feel like you're learning from a friend, not just another developer.

Curios about the projects I've worked on? Feel free to explore my [portfolio](https://ryanjordan.dev), where I showcase my proudest achievements and outline how we can collaborate to innovate and create. If you're as excited about technology as I am, you're in the right place. Let's explore the future of coding together!

Beyond the blog, I'm a fervent advocate for open-source projects and a mentor to the next wave of tech talents. I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much, guiding new developers as they start their own journeys in this dynamic field.

My go to tech stack these days are React with TypeScript (or NestJS depending on the project), Jest and Docker for helping me host on a Linode server.
